Employee Payroll System in Java
This project implements a basic Employee Payroll System in Java, showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance and polymorphism. 
It defines a base Employee class and extends it to handle different types of employees with unique pay structures, including hourly, salaried, and executive employees.

Project Structure
Employee: The base class representing a general employee with basic details like ID, name, and designation.
HourlyEmployee: A subclass of Employee for employees paid hourly, including fields for hourly rate and hours worked, and a method to calculate weekly salary.
SalariedEmployee: A subclass of Employee for employees with a fixed monthly salary, including a method to calculate weekly salary.
ExecutiveEmployee: A subclass of SalariedEmployee for executives, with an added bonus percentage and methods to calculate an annual bonus.

Key Features
Demonstrates inheritance by creating specialized classes for different employee types.
Uses polymorphism to override methods and customize output for each employee type.
Simple and beginner-friendly Java code, with straightforward structure for learning OOP concepts.
